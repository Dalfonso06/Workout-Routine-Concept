# Workout-Routine-Concept

Creating a concept for a workout app, specifically the routine part of it. This should include:
  - Adding certain workouts to each category [Push, Pull, Legs, Core, Other, Rest]
  - Keep track of what day of week it is and what category should be done that day
  - Should be able to print out a schedule with the workouts in each cycle being rotated
  
Example
M[Legs]   T[Push]   W[Pull]   T[Legs]   F[Push]   S[Other]   S[Rest]

For each category should be different Leg workouts, push workouts, etc. to later cycle specific workouts in those categories, so that a "user" wouldn't stay in the same routine.
